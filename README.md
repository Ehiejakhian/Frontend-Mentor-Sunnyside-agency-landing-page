## Meet Me
Good day. I'm Ehi. I'm an aspiring developer from Edo, Nigeria. I took this challenge. Here's how I did it and thanks for reading!


**[More on me](https://ehiejakhian.github.io/)**

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

I know, It doesn't match it very much, or even at all. I gave it my all though.

## My process
I started this one by opening the design images in GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). I measure the paddings, gutters (gaps) and sizes of responsive elements. These help me create responsive functions and mixins. Then, I write my HTML, and give class names using BEM which I recently learned. I use SCSS to create my styling so BEM makes it easier.

After my HTML, I start styling with padding. I set the margin of all elements to zero and then give all elements borders. This helps me visualize all element boundaries - all this I do without adding any color.

Then, I add color, backgrounds and border radii to the assigned elements. I prefer using Comic Sans MS and or Outfit as my font because they feel relaxing to my eyes and help me think better. I can't explain it though, it's just a feeling.

Weird, right?üòÅ

Then I modularize my SASS files and compile them.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- **No Javascript**

### What I learned

I learned how to make a grid behave as if it has the flex-firection property. Using the **`directon()`** property, one can easily acheive this:
````scss
.standOut {
  direction: rtl;
  &__content {
    direction: ltr;
  }
}
````
The child elements inherit the parent's value, so we reverse that.


### Continued development

I would love to get the design better next time.

### Useful resources

- [Coding2Go's "Create a Responsize navbar - a CSS only solution"](https://youtu.be/8eFeIFKAKHw?si=GzljC16g9cEAOXLY) - This is an amazing video that I'll recommend to all out there who want to use only CSS to create nav-bars and make their lives simpler.
